# Tests

The Python file ```test_script.py ``` is the test file containing two classes: TestUpload2S3 and
TestDownloadAnnotationsFromHasty. These classes are designed to test the functionality of the Upload2S3 and
DownloadAnnotationsFromHasty classes, respectively. The tests use the unittest module to set up the necessary conditions
and make assertions on the expected results.

Feel free to add more tests to the test file to test the functionality of the scripts.
